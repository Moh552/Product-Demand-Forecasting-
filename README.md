Product Demand Forecasting ðŸš€
A simple and interactive machine learning tool to analyze and predict product demand using AI models.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Product Demand Forecasting is a Python GUI application built with Tkinter that allows users to upload, process, and analyze CSV data. It provides machine learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors & Random Forest) to classify and predict product demand with ease.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… User-friendly GUI â€“ No coding skills required!
âœ… Upload and edit CSV data easily.
âœ… Train AI models (KNN & Random Forest) for classification.
âœ… View and analyze model performance with accuracy reports.
âœ… Save trained models for future use.

ðŸ›  How It Works?
Load Data â€“ Select a CSV file and choose the target column.
Process Data â€“ Remove unwanted columns and preview the dataset.
Train Model â€“ Choose KNN or Random Forest, and train the model.
View Results â€“ Get classification reports and performance metrics.
Save Model â€“ Export the trained model for later use.
